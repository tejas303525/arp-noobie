#  What is ARP?
#Adress Resolution Protocol is responsible for knowing the mac address of a system.
#i.e it stores the corresponding ip address of the mac address in the system so that the next time when the sytem uses that ip to request the data packets will know where to go exactly.
#
# How does this work?
# Lets say a user opens a browser and searches for something on web, and with the help of Http or DNS( from application layer) it brings up a secure connection to that service. The tcp connection(transport layer)
#  writes src and dest ports and now since it has ports it need to place ip address and thats when it comes to layer 3, the network layer. the user's computer is going to be placed at src address and the destination address as server's IP address(which is found out by the help of DNS) and passses it to layer2 which is the data link layer via ethernet cable\.
# Layer2 is going to add the mac address of user as src and waits for destination mac address as dest and  this is where  arp  will start broadcasting destination ip address and wait for the destination ip to respond back with its mac address
# IP --> arp_cache-->macaddress
